I am a final year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science at PKU, advised by Prof. [Hao Dong](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/haodong/index.htm).
I received my bachelor degree in 2021, from [Turing Class](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/turingprogram/introduction1/index.htm) in PKU.
Currently, I am excited to be working with [Jianlan Luo](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jianlanluo/) at [AgiBot](https://www.agibot.com/) on some challenging problems.
My recent research focuses on real world reinforcement learning algorithms and robotic systems with tactile sensing, building future data-flying-wheel applications.
